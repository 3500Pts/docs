# Introduction

The AO Standard defines a client-server protocol, and the communication is done through packets.
These packets can either be sent over a TCP or Websocket connection.
This documentation provides a how these are structured and used.

All packets sent need to adhere to types and restrictions outlined
in Packet Reference and be serialized as specified in Serialization.
