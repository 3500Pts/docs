# Common Errors/Bugs (both content and generic)

It's regretful how I have to type this section up (considering #tech_support and #content exists on the AO Discord), but for the uninitiated who don't know how to use the Discord search bar, this document is made just for you.

## My client won't start!

Okay, there's 4 different issues you'll run into for this one, to which there's 3 solutions. I'll go through each issue one-by-one:

### You get an error pop-up that has either (0xc000007b) or MSVCP140_1.dll

This one, thankfully for you, is pretty simple. The tl;dr here is that your computer's complaining about not having some files that didn't come with AO (as we would've hoped by now that your probably-massive Steam library beat you to the install first).

Just download and install [this](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe), and it'll be up and running!

## "It looks like your client isn't set up correctly"

If you get this error, probably means you did one of two things:

 - You downloaded only the executable and the DLLs needed for it
 - The download that your non-Vanilla server gave you is fucked up.
 - 
 The solution for both those scenarios? Download the latest *official* release of the client, or get someone from your server's Discord to give you a download that includes at *minimum* the `base\themes` folder. **Please note that you won't be able to join any servers as a character until you have downl
